Prompt number: 2
Prompt: 
Examine the SVG path element provided. Begin by parsing the path into its individual segments and lines. Visualize each segment and combine them to form the overall shape. Count the number of sides and measure the angles between them. Look for any patterns or symmetries that may help in identifying the shape. Consider common geometric properties and compare them with the visualized shape. Ensure thorough analysis to accurately determine the geometric figure represented by the SVG path.
