(K) trapezoid",(K),"Based on the SVG path element provided, the path draws a rectangle. 

Explanation:
- The path starts at point (50.00, 45.00) and moves to point (77.00, 45.00) creating a horizontal line segment.
- It then moves to point (77.00, 33.00) creating a vertical line segment.
- Next, it moves to point (50.00, 33.00) creating another horizontal line segment.
- Finally, it closes the path by moving back to the starting point (50.00, 45.00) creating the last vertical line segment.

By connecting these points, it forms a rectangle with sides of equal length. Therefore, the correct answer is (H) rectangle.",False
